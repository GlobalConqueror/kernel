# Info

Every directory which is located at `kernel/[DIRECTORY]` contains an info file which outlines relevant information about it and all immediate sub-directories.

All project file directories, aka a directory which is the root of a Cargo or Visual Studio project, contain a `description.md` file which contains an overview - describing what the project is exactly, a Language section - detailing which programming language(s) are currently being implemented in the project and why, and an Errors section - outline all logic errors currently present in the code.
