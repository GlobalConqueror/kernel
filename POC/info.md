# Information

Anything presented in this directory (as of now) is a user land program, designed to demonstrate or replicate the theoretical functionality of a low level system which has not yet been implemented.

The structure of such a directory follows the standard structure of either a Cargo (for Rust) or Visual Studio (for C/C++) project, with the target directory removed in the case of Cargo projects.
